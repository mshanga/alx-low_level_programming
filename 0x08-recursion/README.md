# INTRODUTION
#
-> Welcome to the read me file of Project 8.

-> This is a task on recursion while learning the C-programming language

-> It is Expideient to note here that it has always been very interesting when you know what to do and how to do it.

-> All files were uploaded from the terminal

-> All required files were installed and edited with the approved system

-> For this porject i used the VI tool to edit update all files

# HERE ARE THE LIST OF ALL THE FILES CREATED IN THIS PROJECT

	0-puts_recursion.c: function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
	
	1-print_rev_recursion.c: function that prints a string in reverse.

	2-strlen_recursion.c:  function that returns the length of a string.

	3-factorial.c: function that returns the factorial of a given number.

	4-pow_recursion.c: function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.

	5-sqrt_recursion.c:  function that returns the natural square root of a number.

	6-is_prime_number.c: function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.

	100-is_palindrome.c: function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.

	101-wildcmp.c: function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.
